In this analysis, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights. We used Python with the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.  The process began with loading the dataset and performing initial exploration using functions like .head(), .info(), and .describe().  We then conducted univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables through histograms and boxplots, and examined categorical data with count plots. Bivariate analysis explored relationships between pairs of variables using scatterplots, boxplots, and crosstabs, while multivariate analysis used pair plots and heatmaps to identify complex interactions.  Finally, we summarized our findings, highlighting key patterns, trends, and potential anomalies in the data.
